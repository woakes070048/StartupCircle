# StartupCircle
Community of local Startups founders, entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs helping each other.


Things to consider while posting to the group:

* The post need to be relevant and valuable to startups, founders and aspiring entrepreneurs.
* Avoid personal promotion.
* Better to ask what you are seeking, instead of posting about your services/product.
* Plain text posts are given more priority, than just links or re-sharing the link of your page.
* Avoid photos in the posts, see if they are really needed.
* Posts with only a link are seldom approved.
* If you run a tech blog, refrain from posting each of your posts. Posting once in a while is okay.
* Startups can post job requirements, not HR agencies.
* If your post is not approved, try validating it with community guidelines.
* There would be no warning, after three repetitive unapproved posts, the account would be banned.
* For joining the Facebook group, your account must be six months old. We encounter most spam from just created accounts.
* You can give suggestions for improving the community guidelines by editing this document.

Please refrain from posting:

* Spam, link baiting
* Profane, defamatory, offensive or violent language
* “Trolling”, or posting deliberately disruptive statements meant to hijack comment threads or throw discussions off-track
* Files containing viruses that could damage the operation of other people’s computers or mobile devices
* Attacks on specific groups or any comments meant to harass, threaten or abuse an individual
* Hateful or discriminatory comments regarding race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, sexual orientation or political beliefs
* Links or comments containing sexually explicit content material
* Discussion of illegal activity
* Acknowledgement of intent to stalk an individual or collect private information without disclosure
* Content determined to be inappropriate, in poor taste, or otherwise contrary to the purposes of the forum
